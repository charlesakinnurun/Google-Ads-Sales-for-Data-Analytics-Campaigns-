3. What is the id with the highest conversion_rate?
4. What is the total cost incurred across all campaigns?
5. Which location generated the most leads?
6. How many unique campaign_name are present in the dataset?
7. What is the average cost per click?
8. Which device type has the highest average impressions?
9. What is the maximum sale_amount recorded for a single ad?
10. How many conversions were recorded on '2024-11-16'?
11. What is the total number of impressions for ads with location 'Hyderabad'?
12. Which keyword is associated with the highest number of leads?
13. What is the average conversion_rate for ads run on 'Mobile' device?
14. How many ads have a cost greater than the average cost?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the digital advertising strategies, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
- **Numpy:** Essential for numerical and scientific computing. It's especially important in data analysis,data science and machine Learning.
- **Pandas:** Essential python library used for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning.
# Database Creation
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA `googleads`;
```
# Table Creation
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales(
  id VARCHAR(255),
  campaign_name VARCHAR(255),
  clicks FLOAT,
  impressions FLOAT,
  cost FLOAT,
  leads FLOAT,
  conversions FLOAT,
  conversion_rate FLOAT,
  sale_amount FLOAT,
  ad_date DATE,
  location VARCHAR(255),
  device VARCHAR(255),
  keyword VARCHAR(255),
);
```
# The Cleaning
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('dataset/data.csv')

# Standardize column names
df.columns = (
    df.columns.str.strip()
    .str.lower()
    .str.replace(' ', '_')
    .str.replace('-', '_')
)

# Remove $ and convert to float
for col in ['cost', 'sale_amount']:
    df[col] = (
        df[col]
        .astype(str)
        .str.replace('$', '', regex=False)
        .replace('', np.nan)
        .astype(float)
    )

# Standardize date formats
def parse_date(x):
    for fmt in ("%Y-%m-%d", "%d-%m-%Y", "%Y/%m/%d", "%d/%m/%Y"):
        try:
            return pd.to_datetime(x, format=fmt)
        except:
            continue
    return pd.NaT

df['ad_date'] = df['ad_date'].apply(parse_date)

# Standardize text columns
def fix_campaign(x):
    x = x.lower().replace(' ', '').replace('_', '')
    if 'dataanalyticscourse' in x:
        return 'DataAnalyticsCourse'
    return 'Data Analytics Course'

df['campaign_name'] = df['campaign_name'].apply(fix_campaign)

def fix_location(x):
    x = str(x).strip().lower()
    if 'hyder' in x:
        return 'Hyderabad'
    return x.capitalize()

df['location'] = df['location'].apply(fix_location)

def fix_device(x):
    x = str(x).strip().lower()
    if 'desk' in x:
        return 'Desktop'
    if 'mob' in x:
        return 'Mobile'
    if 'tab' in x:
        return 'Tablet'
    return x.capitalize()

df['device'] = df['device'].apply(fix_device)

# Standardize keywords
df['keyword'] = df['keyword'].str.strip().str.lower()

# Fill missing numeric values with median
for col in ['clicks', 'impressions', 'cost', 'leads', 'conversions', 'conversion_rate', 'sale_amount']:
    if df[col].dtype in [np.float64, np.int64, float, int]:
        df[col] = df[col].fillna(df[col].median())

# Save cleaned data
df.to_csv('dataset/data_cleaned.csv', index=False)
print("Data cleaned and saved to dataset/data_cleaned.csv")
```
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:
### 1.What is the average number of clicks for all advertisements?
```sql
SELECT AVG(clicks) AS average_clicks
FROM ads;
```
### 2.Which campaign_name has the highest total sale_amount?
```sql
SELECT campaign_name, SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY campaign_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
### 3.What is the id with the highest conversion_rate?
```sql
SELECT id,conversion_rate
FROM sales
ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
The remaining queries are provided below.
